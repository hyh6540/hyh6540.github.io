<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a Research Fellow at the College of Computing and Data Science, Nanyang Technological University, under the supervision of Prof. [Jun Luo](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/junluo/). I received a Ph.D. degree from the College of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University, supervised by Prof. Guanding Yu, Prof. Yunlong Cai, and Prof. Jinsong Han. I obtained my bachelor's degree in Information Engineering from Zhejiang University in 2018. 

My research focuses on wireless communication, integrated sensing and communication, and mobile edge computing. I have published more than 20 papers with <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ldVs-W0AAAAJ&hl=en'>total google scholar citations being <strong><span id='total_cit'> 2000+</span></strong></a>!
